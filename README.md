=====

An _expressive_ open-source speed-reading application written in Javascript.

# About

**Drama** is a heavy modification of Spray, meant to allow the author of the text being speed read to add markup in order to make its delivery more expressive.

**Spray** is an open-source speed-reading application written in Javascript by [Chaim Peck](https://github.com/chaimpeck/spray). It was inspired by [OpenSpritz](https://raw.github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz/) and currently contains the algorithm from that project.
